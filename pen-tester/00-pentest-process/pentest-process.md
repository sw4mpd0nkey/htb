# Penetration Testing Process

A pentest aims to uncover and identify ALL vulnerabilities in the systems under investigation and improve the security for the tested systems.
## Types of Penetration Testing

| **Type**         | **Information Provided**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Blackbox`       | `Minimal`. Only the essential information, such as IP addresses and domains, is provided.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Greybox`        | `Extended`. In this case, we are provided with additional information, such as specific URLs, hostnames, subnets, and similar.                                                                                                                                        |
| `Whitebox`       | `Maximum`. Here everything is disclosed to us. This gives us an internal view of the entire structure, which allows us to prepare an attack using internal information. We may be given detailed configurations, admin credentials, web application source code, etc. |
| `Red-Teaming`    | May include physical testing and social engineering, among other things. Can be combined with any of the above types.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Purple-Teaming` | It can be combined with any of the above types. However, it focuses on working closely with the defenders.                                                                                                                                                            |

### **Stage** | **Description**
`1. Pre-Engagement` The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.
`2. Information Gathering` Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.
`3. Vulnerability Assessment` With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.
`4. Exploitation` Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.
`5. Post-Exploitation` Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, 
we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).
`6. Lateral Movement` If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.
`7. Proof-of-Concept` We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger 
these vulnerabilities.
`8. Post-Engagement` Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings.

## Penetration Testing Phases 

### 1. Pre-Engagement

The entire pre-engagement process consists of three essential components:
1. Scoping questionnaire
2. Pre-engagement meeting
3. Kick-off meeting
Before any of these can be discussed in detail, a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) must be signed by all parties. There are several types of NDAs:

| **Type**                                                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Unilateral NDA`                                                     | This type of NDA obligates only one party to maintain confidentiality and allows the other party to share the information received with third parties.                                                  |
| `Bilateral NDA`                                                      | In this type, both parties are obligated to keep the resulting and acquired information confidential. This is the most common type of NDA that protects the work of penetration testers.                |
| `Multilateral NDA`                                                   | Multilateral NDA is a commitment to confidentiality by more than two parties. If we conduct a penetration test for a cooperative network, all parties responsible and involved must sign this document. |
| **Document**                                                         | **Timing for Creation**                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `1. Non-Disclosure Agreement` (`NDA`)                                | `After` Initial Contact                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `2. Scoping Questionnaire`                                           | `Before` the Pre-Engagement Meeting                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `3. Scoping Document`                                                | `During` the Pre-Engagement Meeting                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `4. Penetration Testing Proposal` (`Contract/Scope of Work` (`SoW`)) | `During` the Pre-engagement Meeting                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `5. Rules of Engagement` (`RoE`)                                     | `Before` the Kick-Off Meeting                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `6. Contractors Agreement` (Physical Assessments)                    | `Before` the Kick-Off Meeting                                                                                                                                                                           |

### 2. Information Gathering 

 We can obtain the necessary information relevant to us in many different ways. However, we can divide them into the following categories:
- Open-Source Intelligence
- Infrastructure Enumeration
- Service Enumeration
- Host Enumeration
 The more precise this information is, the easier it will be to disguise our attacks (Evasive Testing).

### 3. Vulnerability Assessment 

An analysis is a detailed examination of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that with the help of certain precautions and actions, can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences. 

### **Analysis Type** | **Description**
`Descriptive` Descriptive analysis is essential in any data analysis. On the one hand, it describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection or outliers in the data set.

`Diagnostic` Diagnostic analysis clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. We must take a backward-looking view, similar to descriptive analysis, with the subtle difference that we try to find reasons for events and developments.

`Predictive` By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible.

`Prescriptive` Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or process.

### 4. Exploitation 

During the `Exploitation` stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.)

Once we have found one or two vulnerabilities during the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage that we can apply to our target network/system, we can prioritize those attacks. Which of those attacks we prioritize higher than the others depends on the following factors:

- Probability of Success
- Complexity
- Probability of Damage

### 5. Post-Exploitation 

The `Post-Exploitation` stage aims to obtain sensitive and security-relevant information from a local perspective and business-relevant information that, in most cases, requires higher privileges than a standard user. This stage includes:
1. Evasive Testing
2. Information Gathering
3. Pillaging -->  we examine the role of the host in the corporate network
4. Vulnerability Assessment
5. (Privilege) Exploitation
6. Persistence --> once we have an overview of the system, our immediate next step is maintaining access to the exploited host. This way, if the connection is interrupted, we can still access it.
7. Data Exfiltration --> we will often be able to find, among other things, considerable personal information and customer data.

### 6. Lateral Movement  

The goal here is that we test what an attacker could do within the entire network. After all, the main goal is not only to successfully exploit a publicly available system but also to get sensitive data or find all ways that an attacker could render the network unusable.

In this stage, we want to test how far we can move manually in the entire network and what vulnerabilities we can find from the internal perspective that might be exploited. We again run through:
1. Pivoting
2. Evasive Testing
3. Information Gathering
4. Vulnerability Assessment
5. (Privilege) Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation

### 7. Proof-of-Concept

`Proof of Principle` is a project management term. In project management, it serves as proof that a project is feasible in principle.


### 8. Post-Engagement 

`Post-engagement` in penetration testing refers to the activities that occur after the active testing phase. This phase is crucial for ensuring that the value of the penetration test is fully realized. Here’s what typically happens during post-engagement:

1. **Data Analysis**: The data gathered during the penetration test is analyzed to identify and understand the vulnerabilities, the methods used to exploit them, and the potential impact on the organization.
    
2. **Reporting**: A comprehensive report is created detailing the vulnerabilities found, the exploitation methods, and the potential risks. The report should be clear and actionable, providing prioritized recommendations for remediation.
    
3. **Risk Analysis**: The risks associated with the identified vulnerabilities are assessed to help the organization prioritize which issues to address first based on their potential impact.
    
4. **Debriefing**: A meeting with the stakeholders to discuss the findings, the implications of the vulnerabilities, and the recommended next steps.
    
5. **Remediation**: The organization begins the process of patching the vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended security measures.
    
6. **Re-Testing**: After remediation efforts are completed, it may be necessary to perform a re-test to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed and that no new issues have been introduced.
    
7. **Documentation**: All the steps taken, from the initial findings to the final remediation, should be documented to improve future security measures and for compliance purposes.
    
8. **Follow-Up**: Continuous communication between the penetration testers and the organization to ensure that all recommendations are understood and implemented correctly.
