# Server Message Block

Server Message Block (SMB) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. With the free software project Samba, there is also a solution that enables the use of SMB in Linux and Unix distributions and thus cross-platform communication via SMB.

## Samba

As mentioned earlier, there is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (CIFS) network protocol. CIFS is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate effectively with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it is often referred to as SMB/CIFS.

CIFS is considered a specific version of the SMB protocol, primarily aligning with SMB version 1. When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP ports 137, 138, and 139. In contrast, CIFS operates over TCP port 445 exclusively. There are several versions of SMB, including newer versions like SMB 2 and SMB 3, which offer improvements and are preferred in modern infrastructures, while older versions like SMB 1 (CIFS) are considered outdated but may still be used in specific environments.

|SMB Version|Supported|Features|
|-----------|---------|--------|
|CIFS|Windows NT 4.0|Communication via NetBIOS interface|
|SMB 1.0|Windows 2000 |Direct connection via TCP|
|SMB 2.0|Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008|Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature|
|SMB 2.1|Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2|Locking mechanisms|
|SMB 3.0|Windows 8, Windows Server 2012|Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access|
|SMB 3.0.2|Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2|   | 	
|SMB 3.1.1|Windows 10, Windows Server 2016|Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption|

## Default Configuration

As we can imagine, Samba offers a wide range of settings that we can configure. Again, we define the settings via a text file where we can get an overview of some of the settings. These settings look like the following when filtered out:

### Default Configuration

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;" 

[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.HTB
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly. Let us look at some of the settings to understand how the shares are configured in Samba.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `[sharename]` | The name of the network share. |
| `workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN` | Workgroup that will appear when clients query. |
| `path = /path/here/` | The directory to which user is to be given access. |
| `server string = STRING` | The string that will show up when a connection is initiated. |
| `unix password sync = yes` | Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password? |
| `usershare allow guests = yes` | Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share? |
| `map to guest = bad user` | What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user? |
| `browseable = yes` | Should this share be shown in the list of available shares? |
| `guest ok = yes` | Allow connecting to the service without using a password? |
| `read only = yes` | Allow users to read files only? |
| `create mask = 0700` | What permissions need to be set for newly created files? |

### Dangerous Settings

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `browseable = yes` | Allow listing available shares in the current share? |
| `read only = no` | Forbid the creation and modification of files? |
| `writable = yes` | Allow users to create and modify files? |
| `guest ok = yes` | Allow connecting to the service without using a password? |
| `enable privileges = yes` | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID? |
| `create mask = 0777` | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files? |
| `directory mask = 0777` | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh` | What script needs to be executed on the user's login? |
| `magic script = script.sh` | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed? |
| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored? |

## Footprinting the Service

### Nmap

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-19 15:15 CEST

```

We can see from the results that it is not very much that Nmap provided us with here. Therefore, we should resort to other tools that allow us to interact manually with the SMB and send specific requests for the information. One of the handy tools for this is rpcclient. This is a tool to perform MS-RPC functions.

### RPCclient 

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```

| **Query** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `srvinfo` | Server information. |
| `enumdomains` | Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network. |
| `querydominfo` | Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains. |
| `netshareenumall` | Enumerates all available shares. |
| `netsharegetinfo <share>` | Provides information about a specific share. |
| `enumdomusers` | Enumerates all domain users. |
| `queryuser <RID>` | Provides information about a specific user. |


#### RPCclient - Enumeration

Example showing us what information can be leaked to anonymous users. Once an anonymous user has access to a network service, it only takes one mistake to give them too many permissions or too much visibility to put the entire network at significant risk.

#### Brute Forcing User RIDs

How to manyally do the brute force:
```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done

        User Name   :   sambauser
        user_rid :      0x1f5
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   mrb3n
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   cry0l1t3
        user_rid :      0x3e9
        group_rid:      0x201
```

An alternative to this would be a Python script from Impacket called samrdump.py.
