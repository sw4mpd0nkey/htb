# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers. SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails. In principle, it is a client-server-based protocol, although SMTP can be used between a client and a server and between two SMTP servers. In this case, a server effectively acts as a client.

## Default Configuration

Each SMTP server can be configured in many ways, as can all other services. However, there are differences because the SMTP server is only responsible for sending and forwarding emails.

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix
```

The sending and communication are also done by special commands that cause the SMTP server to do what the user requires.

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `AUTH PLAIN` | AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client. |
| `HELO` | The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session. |
| `MAIL FROM` | The client names the email sender. |
| `RCPT TO` | The client names the email recipient. |
| `DATA` | The client initiates the transmission of the email. |
| `RSET` | The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server. |
| `VRFY` | The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer. |
| `EXPN` | The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command. |
| `NOOP` | The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out. |
| `QUIT` | The client terminates the session. |

### Telnet

#### HELO/EHLO

To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the telnet tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, HELO or EHLO.

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 


HELO mail1.inlanefreight.htb

250 mail1.inlanefreight.htb


EHLO mail1

250-mail1.inlanefreight.htb
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10240000
250-ETRN
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
250-8BITMIME
250-DSN
250-SMTPUTF8
250 CHUNKING
```

#### VRFY

The command VRFY can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue code 252 and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found here.

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 

VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root


VRFY cry0l1t3

252 2.0.0 cry0l1t3

```

Did you make any changes there?

## Dangerous Settings

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

### Open Relay Configuration


> mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0

With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.


## Footprinting the Service

### Nmap

The default Nmap scripts include smtp-commands, which uses the EHLO command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.

```
frank-106@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25
