# Post-Exploitation Persistence

---

Now that we've worked so hard to obtain this foothold, we don't want to lose it. The goal is to use this host as a pivot point to access the rest of the internal network. Our shell is still relatively unstable, and we don't want to keep setting up our access with multiple steps because we want to be as efficient as possible and spend as much time on the actual assessment, not fiddling around with shells.

---

## Sinking Our Hooks In

Now that we have credentials (`srvadm:ILFreightnixadm!`), we can leverage the SSH port we saw open earlier and connect in for a stable connection. This is important because we want to be able to get back as close as possible to the same spot at the start of testing each day, so we don't have to waste time on setup. Now we won't always have SSH open to the internet and may have to achieve persistence another way. We could create a reverse shell binary on the host, execute it via the command injection, get a reverse shell or Meterpreter shell, and then work through that. Since SSH is here, we'll use it. There are many ways to pivot and tunnel our traffic which were covered in-depth in the [Pivoting, Tunneling, and Port Forwarding](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/158) module, so it's worth trying out some of them in this section to get extra practice. We will need to use some of these as we go deeper into this network. It's also good to have a backup way to get back in when using someone's credentials, as they may notice that their account is compromised or just hit that time of the month when they are prompted to change their password, and we won't be able to connect back in the next day. We should always be thinking ahead, analyzing every angle, and trying to anticipate issues before they arise. A lab is much different from the real world, and there are no resets or do-overs, so we need to work meticulously and maintain situational awareness as best as possible.

Now that we have a stable connection via SSH, we can start enumerating further.

## Local Privilege Escalation

We could upload an enumeration script to the system such as [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS), but I always try two simple commands after gaining access: `id` to see if the compromised account is in any privileged local groups, and `sudo -l` to see if the account has any type of `sudo` privileges to run commands as another user or as root. By now, we have practiced many privilege escalation techniques in both Academy modules and perhaps some boxes on the HTB main platform. It's great to have these techniques in our back pocket, especially if we land on a very hardened system. However, we are dealing with human administrators, and humans make mistakes and also go for convenience. More often than not, my path to escalating privileges on a Linux box during a pentest was not some wildcard attack leveraging tar and a cron job, but rather something simple such as `sudo su` without a password to gain root privileges or not having to escalate privileges because the service I exploited was running in the context of the root account. It's still necessary to understand and practice as many techniques as possible because, as said a few times now, every environment is different, and we want to have the most comprehensive toolkit possible at our disposal.

Post-Exploitation Persistence

```shell-session
srvadm@dmz01:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for srvadm on dmz01:
  env_reset, mail_badpass,
  secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User srvadm may run the following commands on dmz01:
  (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/openssl
```

Running `sudo -l`, we see that we can run the `/usr/bin/openssl` command as root without requiring a password. As suspected, there is a [GTFOBin](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/openssl/) for the OpenSSL binary. The entry shows various ways this can be leveraged: to upload and download files, gain a reverse shell, and read and write files. Let's try this to see if we can grab the SSH private key for the root user. This is ideal over just attempting to read the `/etc/shadow` file or obtain a reverse shell as the `ida_rsa` private key file will grant us SSH back into the environment as the root user, which is perfect for setting up our pivots.

The entry states that we can use the binary for privileged file reads as follows:

Post-Exploitation Persistence

```shell-session
LFILE=file_to_read
openssl enc -in "$LFILE"
```

Let's give it a try

```shell-session
srvadm@dmz01:~$ LFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
srvadm@dmz01:~$ sudo /usr/bin/openssl enc -in $LFILE

## Establishing Persistence

Success! We can now save the private key to our local system, modify the privileges, and use it to SSH as root and confirm root privileges.

It worked, and we're in and now have a "save point" to get back into the internal environment quickly and can use this SSH access to set up port forwards and pivot internally.
